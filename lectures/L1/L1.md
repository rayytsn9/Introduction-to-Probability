## Motivating Example - Birthday Problem

**Question:** What is the minimum number of people needed in a group for there to be at least a 50% probability that two people share the same birthday?

### Solution Approach

Use complement probability: P(at least one shared birthday) = 1 - P(no shared birthdays)

### Assumptions
- 365 days in a year (ignoring leap years)
- All birthdays are equally likely
- Birthdays are independent

### Calculation

For n people, the probability that no two share a birthday is:
P(no shared) = (365/365) × (364/365) × (363/365) × ... × ((365-n+1)/365)

Therefore:
P(at least one shared) = 1 - P(no shared)

### Answer

**The minimum number of people needed is 23.**

At n = 23, the probability of at least one shared birthday is approximately 50.73%.

### Key Insight
This result is counterintuitive - most people guess much higher numbers (often 100+). The birthday problem demonstrates how quickly probabilities can accumulate with independent events.

## Probability Space (Ω, F, P)

A **probability space** is a mathematical construct that provides a formal framework for probability theory. It consists of three components:

• **Sample space (Ω):** The set of all possible outcomes of a random experiment
  - Example: For a coin flip, Ω = {H, T}
  - Example: For rolling a die, Ω = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}

• **Collection of events (F):** A σ-algebra (sigma-algebra) of subsets of Ω
  - Contains all events we can assign probabilities to
  - Must be closed under complementation and countable unions
  - Example: For coin flip, F = {∅, {H}, {T}, {H,T}}

• **Probability measure (P):** A function P: F → [0,1] that assigns probabilities to events
  - P(∅) = 0 (impossible event has probability 0)
  - P(Ω) = 1 (certain event has probability 1)
  - For disjoint events A₁, A₂, ..., P(∪ᵢ Aᵢ) = Σᵢ P(Aᵢ) (countable additivity)

### **Kolmogorov's Axioms (1933):**

The probability measure P must satisfy these three axioms:

**i.** **Non-negativity:** P(A) ≥ 0 for all events A ∈ F

**ii.** **Normalization:** P(Ω) = 1 (the probability of the sample space is 1)

**iii.** **Countable additivity:** For any countable collection of mutually exclusive / disjoint events A₁, A₂, A₃, ... in F:
    P(∪ᵢ₌₁^∞ Aᵢ) = Σᵢ₌₁^∞ P(Aᵢ)

### Key Properties Derived from the Axioms:

• P(∅) = 0
• P(Aᶜ) = 1 - P(A) (complement rule)
• If A ⊆ B, then P(A) ≤ P(B) (monotonicity)
• P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B) (inclusion-exclusion principle)

## Example 1 - Flipping a Fair Coin

**Probability space (Ω, F, P):**

• **Sample space:** Ω = {H, T} (Heads, Tails)

• **Collection of events:** F = {∅, {H}, {T}, {H,T}} (all possible subsets)

• **Probability measure:** P({H}) = 1/2, P({T}) = 1/2, P(∅) = 0, P({H,T}) = 1

**Kolmogorov's axioms are satisfied since:**

**i.** P(A) ≥ 0 for all A ∈ F (all probabilities are non-negative)

**ii.** P(Ω) = P({H,T}) = 1 (probability of sample space is 1)

**iii.** For disjoint events, P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) (e.g., P({H} ∪ {T}) = P({H}) + P({T}) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1)

=================================================

## Example 2 - Rolling a Standard Six-Sided Die

**Probability space (Ω, F, P):**

• **Sample space:** Ω = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}

• **Collection of events:** F = all possible subsets of Ω (2^6 = 64 subsets)

• **Probability measure:** P({i}) = 1/6 for each i ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}

A possible event in Ω is:
**A = {the outcome is divisible by 3} = {3, 6}**

P(A) = P({3, 6}) = P({3}) + P({6}) = 1/6 + 1/6 = 1/3

=================================================

## Example 3 - Flipping a Fair Coin Three Times

**Probability space (Ω, F, P):**

• **Sample space:** Ω = {HHH, HHT, HTH, HTT, THH, THT, TTH, TTT}

• **Collection of events:** F = all possible subsets of Ω (2^8 = 256 subsets)

• **Probability measure:** P({ω}) = 1/8 for each outcome ω ∈ Ω

A possible event in Ω is:
**A = {exactly two heads} = {HHT, HTH, THH}**

P(A) = P({HHT, HTH, THH}) = 3/8
